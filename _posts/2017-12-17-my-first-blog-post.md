## How this blog was created

1. Fork github repo "https://github.com/adeshpande3/adeshpande3.github.io" and rename it as "<username>.github.io" where <username> is your github username
 
1. In this repo, edit file _"_config.yml"_: and update name, description, avatar, footer-links, url. You can edit this file from github itself.

1. Create an _"_posts"_ directory at the top level of this repo (if one does not exist). You can do this by "create new file" from the github repo page with the name _"/_posts"_

1. As the title indicates, this directory will contain your blog posts as separate files. Files should be named using the convention "YYYY-MM-DD-<title>.md" where spaces in the title name are replace by hyphens (e.g. 2017-12-17-My-first-blog-post.md)

1. The blog post is written in markdown syntax. I use prose.io as an online markdown editor. You can publish from prose.io itself. Once you save your changes in prose.io, it will take a couple of minutes for your posts to show up on <username>.github.io
